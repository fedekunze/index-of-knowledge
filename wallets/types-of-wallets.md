## Types of Wallets

To submit a transaction or message to the network, it needs to have the valid signature of the sender, otherwise the transaction won't be broadcasted by full nodes. This signature requires a private key stored in a wallet file in order to authenticate the origin of the message.

Wallets are classified in two types depending on where they store the private keys.

### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets are files that are not connected to the internet. Meaning that the keys stay in the wallet and thus can't be accessed from outside.

#### Hardware wallets

Devices that store the private key securely and offline. It's required create a PIN pass to authorize transactions with the private key.



#### Paper wallets

Private key printed in paper.

### Hot Wallets

These are wallets that are connected to the internet.
